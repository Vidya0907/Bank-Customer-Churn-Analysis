# 📊 Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis

<br/>

## 🔹 Problem  
Banks face **high customer attrition (churn)**, leading to significant **revenue loss**.  
The key challenge: **Which customers are likely to churn, why are they leaving, and how can we retain them?**  

## 🔹 Solution  
This project builds a **data-driven churn analysis & prediction framework**:  
- 📈 **EDA & Statistical Testing** → identify churn drivers (age, geography, complaints, inactivity, etc.)  
- 🤖 **Predictive Model (Logistic Regression)** → classify at-risk customers  
- 📝 **Business Recommendations** → targeted retention strategies (loyalty programs, complaint resolution, cross-sell offers)  
- 🚀 **Next Steps** → scale with advanced ML models + BI dashboards for real-time monitoring  



## 🔹 Tech Stack  
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)  
- **Statistical Tests** (Chi-Square, T-Test)  
- **Visualization** (heatmaps, boxplots, countplots, ROC curves)  






## 🔹 Key Insights  
- **Age** → Customers **45+ churn significantly more**  
- **Balance** → Mid-to-high balance customers churn more than zero-balance customers  
- **Active Membership** → Inactive members are **2x more likely to churn**  
- **Geography** → Churn is highest in **Germany**  
- **Products** → Multi-product customers (2+) churn less, except at 4 products (spike)  
- **Complaints** → Strong churn driver; complaint customers churn much more  
- **Satisfaction** → Lower satisfaction scores → higher churn  



## 🔹 Business Recommendations  
1. **Engagement Program** → loyalty rewards for inactive members  
2. **Complaint Resolution Framework** → faster handling to reduce exits  
3. **Retention Campaigns** → target older, high-balance customers (priority revenue segment)  
4. **Cross-Sell Strategy** → move single-product customers to 2+ products  
5. **Deploy Churn Prediction Model** → proactively flag & retain at-risk customers
